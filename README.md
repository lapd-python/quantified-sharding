# Quantified Sharding

## Motivations
Sharding is often seen as a layer-1 scaling mechanism for blockchain projects. Several proposals have been floated (e.g. Ethereum, Zilliqa et al). However, it is an open research question as to the actual speed up of sharding, and what sharding parameters are appropriate (e.g. number of shards, sharding algorithm).

## Experiment Construction
We take the historical Ethereum chain, and replay historical transactions in a hypothetical sharded  blockchain. We use this experiment to quantify the speedup impact of sharding on the Ethereum blockchain, and the various speedup impacts of different sharding parameters/architecture choices.
